The \"other\" dictionary uses the \"large\" SCOWL size (\"size 70\") and also contains accented words and common variants. This and the other dictionary are both an excellent choice depending on your needs.\n\nSummarising:\n\n    This add-on which is the Mozilla-distributed dictionary: \"Normal\" size, accented words, common variants, additional 2500 proper names, 37 Mozilla-specific terms.\n    The other add-on: \"Large\" size, accented words, common variants.\n\n\nNote: This add-on has changed. Before it distributed the \"large\" SCOWL dictionary, but since the other add-on has now switched to the same, it now distributes the Mozilla dictionary instead.","weeklyDownloads":1691,"type":"dictionary","creator":{"name":"Jorg K","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/user/6190978/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/233/233966.png?modified=1584372049","width":540,"height":260,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/233/233966.png?modified=1584372049","thumbnailWidth":540,"thumbnailHeight":260,"caption":"Use the context menu to enable spellcheck and select a dictionary"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.522,"reviewCount":25,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/us-english-dictionary/reviews/","updateDate":1602453313000}]}
